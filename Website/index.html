    <p class="unbounded-font"> 1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?
    </p> 

    <p class="poppins-regular"> When first interacting with the interactive website, my attention was immediately captured by the generative text that appears when following the cursor. This feature worleld together with the title as it warped as you continued to scroll. I found this facinating as it keeps users engaged with the content, as well as the aesthetic purposes.
    </p>

    <p class="unbounded-font"> 2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.
    </p>

    <p class="poppins-regular"> When conciously observing the details of my interaction with the website, I found that I had moved my cursor around images as I scrolled, as the lines would move slightly in reaction to the cursors presence. I spent some time with the generative text following my cursor, and scrolled up and down a few times, as I found myself fascinated by the visuals of the main title warping and stretching. As I continued scrolling, the images zoomed back and forth, before transitioning into vibrant colours like orange and green, whilst a bold heading appears on screen.
    </p>

    <p class="unbounded-font">3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
    </p>

    <p class="poppins-regular">I was most interested by the text following the cursor as the music played in the background. The pairing of these two elements work together to create a peaceful and calming experience, as I took my time reading the generative text as I slowly moved my mouse along the screen. I also admired the acessibility of font and colour, as it contrasted with the bold dark background making it easier to read.
    </p>

    <p class="unbounded-font"> 4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?
    </p>

    <p class="poppins-regular"> Throughout the 2 minutes of my interaction, the most common action with this experience was the scrolling of the website, as it brought forth a variation of visual experiences such as colour transitions, warping of text, and 3D imaging!
    </p>

    <p class="unbounded-font"> 5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?
    </p>

    <p class="poppins-regular"> The goal of this interactive website was to visually communicate the design process of the Walt Disney Concert Hall. This experience presents to us the iterative stages of design thinking, up until the end result.
    </p>

    <p class="unbounded-font"> 6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
    </p>

    <p class="poppins-regular"> This was communicated through a number of visual experiences such as abstract illustrative sketches, music to provide contextuality, and 3D images of the structure. All these elements worked together to create an engaging and attention grabbing experience.
    </p>

    <p class="unbounded-font"> 7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
    </p>

    <p class="poppins-regular"> i feel like many individuals (young adults) will appreciate the artisitc detail, which makes the scrolling interaction very affective. Users will be drawn to the interactivity of the website, as well as the shifts in boldness and size, whilst the soothing music positions users to stay engaged. This website is very inviting, influencing many engaging with this experience to go back and forth between panels.
    </p>

    <p class="unbounded-font"> 8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?
    </p>

    <p class="poppins-regular"> The website communicates that it is a scrolling experience, as there are many indicators that result once scrolled. For example, the shift in colours, movement in 3D imaging.

    <h1 class="bungee-regular">Week 3</h1>

    <p class="unbounded-font"> 9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?
    </p>

    <p class="poppins-regular"> The website effectively utilises the media form of music throughout the experience, enabling the users amd audience to truly focus on the content at their own pace. However, the music also contextualises the experience, representing the Walt Disney Disney Concert Hall whhere music is the heart of its history.
    </p>

    <p class="unbounded-font"> 10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?
    </p>

    <p class="poppins-regular">When going through this experience, the soothing instrumental music encourages me to take my time to absorb the content and information. The power behind this audio-visual experience creates a calming environment for users, allowing for optimal engagement with the content and its primary goal. 
    </p>

    <p class="unbounded-font"> 11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?
    </p>

    <p class="poppins-regular"> I should feel calm and engaged, and therefore allow myself to fully immerse in the experience and its aesthetic qualities, whilst also taking in its information.
    </p>

    <p class="unbounded-font"> 12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?
    </p>

    <p class="poppins-regular">
      Although I adore many qualities of this website experience, I feel as though the music at times gets too loud at some points, making it hard to focus as it pulls me away from my train of thought. However, other times the volume and melody work perfectly in maintaining a clear mind.  
    </p>

    <p class="unbounded-font"> 13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?
    </p>

    <p class="poppins-regular"> The most satisfying part of the experience was the font panel 'stretching' out as you continue to scroll! I found this very eye catching as it not only looked aesthetically pleasing, but it positioned me to stop and read the heading, as if it were reaching out to me.
    </p>
